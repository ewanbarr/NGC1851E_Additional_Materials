This directory contains utility files to be used with Tempo.

A typical utlity program reads the output of a tempo run and does
something useful with it.  Look for README files in the inidividual
directories for details about each program.

cull:        filter for removing high residuals, reformatting TOAs, etc.
extract:     write residual information in ASCII text form
lk:          ascii residual plots
obswgt:      calculates weights, rms's and chi^2's for data subsets
print_resid: write residual information in ASCII text form
res_avg:     average date-sorted residuals to one point per day
wgttpo:      find optimal weights to make reduced chi^2==1 for data subsets
ut1:         scripts for producing ut1.dat from IERS data
dmx_ranges:  script for optimizing DMX time ranges
pubpar:      script that converts a .par file to publishable form

non_tempo:   scripts not directly related to Tempo but of interest to
             many users of tempo
non_tempo/mjd:    print an MJD in human readable form 
non_tempo/aolst:  calculate LST at Arecibo at a given MJD and UT time
non_tempo/dt:     calculate dispersion delay between two frequencies
