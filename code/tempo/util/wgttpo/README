Notes on wgttpo.pl and wgttpo_emin.pl,  IHS, March 29, 2010.

These perl scripts attempt to find the optimal weights for a set of
INCLUDEd toa files, using equad/efac (wgttpo) or emin/efac (wgttpo_emin).
A new script (wgttpo_equad) aims to use only equad.

Usage:
wgttpo.pl <par file> <toa file>
wgttpo_emin.pl <par file> <toa file>
wgttpo_equad.pl <par file> <toa file>

The toa file must consist of "INCLUDE x.tim" lines; the script will not work
on a file full of toas, nor can it cope with header and toas all in the
same file.  The toa file can contain whatever INFO, JUMP, etc., lines that
you want; these will get written out to the output file.  Existing 
EQUAD/EFAC/EMIN lines will not get written out to the output file but
will be replaced with new values.

The scripts work by making a temporary toa file with the toas from an individual
INCLUDEd tim file, then running tempo multiple times on it using the input
par file.  Wgttpo gradually increments EQUAD until Wmax ( = ratio of
largest to smallest error bar) is down to 2 or until chisq is 1.05, whichever
happens first.  It then determines the remaining EFAC needed to bring
the reduced-chisq to 1.0, then writes out the EQUAD and EFAC lines
along with the INCLUDE line to the output file.  Wgttpo_emin does something
similar, but adjusts EMIN instead of EQUAD.  The target of 2 for Wmax
is just kind-of conventional wisdom and users should feel free to 
change it.  It could be a command-line value or flag option, but it 
isn't (yet).  The wgttpo_equad script, instead, adds EQUAD until the
reduced-chisq is between 1.00 and 1.01.

The fitting will take place using whatever fit flags are set in the par file.
If you have lots of toa files each of short duration, it may be better 
to turn the fitting flags off, assuming you like the starting solution.

The output file is always called wgttpo.out.  In principle, running
tempo -f <par file> wgttpo.out
(with or without fitting) should give you an overall reduced-chisq of 1.0.
In practice, it is often necessary to iterate the process: 
wgttpo, obswgt, wgttpo, obswgt will show you how things evolve.
Once you are happy with wgttpo.out, you can copy it to a more permanent
file name.

Caveat: the scripts are not smart about recognizing when the "best" EFAC
is less than 1.  Yes, this would be an easy enough fix, but it's useful to
be aware of when it happens, as it indicates overestimated error bars.
If you're determined to use thos toas as-is, it might be better to edit
the output file to change those specific EFAC lines to 1.0.
