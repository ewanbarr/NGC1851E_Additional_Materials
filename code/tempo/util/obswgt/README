Notes on obswgt.pl, DJN, 25-March-2010

Use:
  obswgt[flags]

  flags:
     -e: print N_eff=(sum of wgt)^2/(sum of wgt^2) in addition to everything else
     -f: segregate by frequency bin number [int(freq/100)] as well as info.tmp
     -m: print start and end MJDs for each set

What is obswgt used for?

When you run tempo on a file with data subsets from multiple sources
(either multiple frequencies, or multiple backends, or multiple
observatories), it can be useful to know the rms and chi^2 values of the
individual subsets of TOAs, and the overall weight of each subset
in the tempo solution.  Obswgt reports this information.

Specifically, for each data subset, obswgt reports:

1.  The sum of the weights of all of the TOAs for that subset
    (out of a total 1.00000 for all TOAs in that tempo run)
2.  The average weight of TOAs in that subset 
3.  The number of TOAs in that subset
4.  The raw reduced chi^2 of the points in that subset, calculated
    as the total chi^2 of those points divided by the number of
    points in the set. (chi^2/ntoa_in_set)
5.  The adjusted reduced chi^2 of the points.  This is the raw
    chi^2 increased by (ntoa/ndof) where ntoa and ndof are the
    total number of TOAs and the total number of degrees of freedom
    in the full data set.  Basically this value is a "best guess"  
    for the true reduced chi^2 of this data set
6.  Unweighted rms of TOAs in that subset
7.  Weighted rms of TOAs in that subset
8.  Name of subset (from info.tmp file; see below)

How to use:

(1) Put INFO lines in your tempo file as described below
(2) Run tempo on your file
(3) Run "obswgt"

In your TEMPO input TOA file, insert INFO cards such as:

  INFO GBT800
   ... list GBT 800 MHz TOAs here
  INFO GBT1400
   ... list GBT 1400 MHz TOAs here
  INFO AO1400
   ... list Arecibo 1400 MHz TOAs here
  INFO GBT800
   ... list GBT 800 MHz TOAs here

When tempo is run on this file, it will produce a file "info.tmp"
with one line per TOA.  The line associated with a given TOA will
be the contents of the most recent INFO line before it in the Tempo
file.  For example, if the first block of GBT 800 MHz TOAs in the
above example had only three TOAs, and the GBT 1400 MHz block had
two TOAs, the info.tmp file would start out:

  GBT800
  GBT800
  GBT800 
  GBT1400
  GBT1400
  AO1400
   ...
  GBT800   [the next block of GBT 800 MHz TOAs]
   ...

Obswgt reads the info lines from info.tmp along with the residuals from
tempo output file resid2.tmp and calculates the rms, chi^2 and weight
described above.  In this example, there would be three lines output,
one for GBT800 TOAs, one for GBT1400 TOAs, and one for AO1400 TOAs.

Info lines can contain any characters (including spaces).
