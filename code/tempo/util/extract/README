Extract

notes by DJN, 25-March-2010

Extract reads tempo residual output files resid2.tmp and writes the
residuals in ASCII form.  

Use:
  extract [options] [outfile]

  options:
    -h:      Help message, lists what is in each column of the output file.

  parameters:
    outfile: Output file name.  Default is "c.tmp"

The output file has one line per residual with the following columns:
 1. TOA day number in 1966 days (i.e., 1-Jan-1966 = 0)  
    (Here for historic reasons; use MJD, column 7, instead!)
 2. postfit residual (in P)
 3. postfit residual (in microsec)
 4. timing error used by Tempo (in microsec)
 5. prefit residual (in microsec)
 6. orbital phase
 7. MJD
 8. ptype (use as point type in mongo/sm to distinguish points by freq
 9. serial number (1,2,3,....)
10. day of year (day number mod 365.25)
11. observing frequency (in MHz)
12. time of day in seconds
13. serial number, except that this counter skips ahead 10 each time there is 
    a gap of more than 0.25 days or a negative jump in the MJDs
    (useful for separating observations at different epochs in a plot)
14. MJD-50000   (fewer quantization issues than MJD when read by 
    plotting programs)
15. weight of point in tempo fit

Handy tip: to a good approximation, YEAR=(MJD-53005)/365.25+2004.
