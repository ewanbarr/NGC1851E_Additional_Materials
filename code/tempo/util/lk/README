"lk" is the classic ascii residual plotting program.

Useful if you are stuck on an island with nothing but a VT100 
connected to a computer with tempo installed.

To make it: "gfortran -o lk lk.f", substituting the name of your
favorite fortran compiler.  Maybe someday there will be a Makefile.

To run it: type "lk"
