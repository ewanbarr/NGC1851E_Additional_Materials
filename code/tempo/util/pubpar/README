  Usage:
    Command line:  python pubpar.py [options] <parfile>
         IPython:  run pubpar.py [options] <parfile>


  This script takes a parfile output by a Tempo fit and displays
  the fitted parameters with their uncertainties in parentheses
  in a format appropriate for publication.


  Options:
    -h  Show this useful help text.

    -l  Output exponential notation in LaTeX X$\times 10^{Y}$
        format rather than simple XeY format.

    -n <precision>
        Force number of decimals in quoted error to <precision>,
        rather than the default, which is 1 digit, or 2 digits
        when the first digit is a 1.

    -p  Convert rotation frequencies and frequency derivatives to
        periods and period derivatives. F0 must be included.
          F0 --> PER0, F1 --> PER1, etc.

    -s  Force scientific notation.

    -t  Leave Tempo errors as reported in parfile rather than
        doubling them.
