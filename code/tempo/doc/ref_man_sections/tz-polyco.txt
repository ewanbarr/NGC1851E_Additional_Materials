POLYCO.DAT

The polynomial ephemerides are written to file 'polyco.dat'.  Entries
are listed sequentially within the file.  The file format is:

Line  Columns     Item
----  -------   -----------------------------------
  1      1-10   Pulsar Name
        11-19   Date (dd-mmm-yy)
        20-31   UTC (hhmmss.ss)
        32-51   TMID (MJD)
        52-72   DM
        74-79   Doppler shift due to earth motion (10^-4)
        80-86   Log_10 of fit rms residual in periods
  2      1-20   Reference Phase (RPHASE)
        21-38   Reference rotation frequency (F0)
        39-43   Observatory number (see note ** below)
        44-49   Data span (minutes)
        50-54   Number of coefficients
        55-75   Observing frequency (MHz)
        76-80   Binary phase
  3*     1-25   Coefficient 1 (COEFF(1))
        26-50   Coefficient 2 (COEFF(2))
        51-75   Coefficient 3 (COEFF(3))

* Subsequent lines have three coefficients each, up to NCOEFF

The pulse phase and frequency at time T are then calculated as:
       DT = (T-TMID)*1440
    PHASE = RPHASE + DT*60*F0 + COEFF(1) + DT*COEFF(2) + DT^2*COEFF(3) + ....
 FREQ(Hz) = F0 + (1/60)*(COEFF(2) + 2*DT*COEFF(3) + 3*DT^2*COEFF(4) + ....)
        
** Observatory numbers are integers based on the observatory code.
