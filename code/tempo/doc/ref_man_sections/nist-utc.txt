NIST_UTC, NIST_BIPM, NIST_PTB, NIST_AT1 FILES

These files contain clock offsets between UTC(NIST) and other timescales.

The first two lines of these file are ignored.  Subsequent lines have the
format:

    col      item
    1-10    MJD
   11-29    offset

The offset is xxx-UTC(NIST) in nanoseconds, where xxx is UTC, TT(BIPM),
UTC(PTB), or AT1.  Linear interpolation between entries is performed.
