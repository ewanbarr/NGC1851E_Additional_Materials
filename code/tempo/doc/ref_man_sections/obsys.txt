OBSERVATORY COORDINATE FILE (typically 'obsys.dat')

This file contains geographical locations of observatories.  There is
one line per observatory.  

Historically, the information in the first line was used
for TOAs tagged with observatory number 1, the second line for number
2, and so on.  The tenth line corresponds to observatory 'a', the
eleventh to 'b', and so on.  This behavior is still invoked
if column 71 (observatory number) is blanked.  However, an
observatory number ('1'-'9' or 'a'-'z') in column 71 will now
override the default assignment (based on position in the file).

    Col       Item
   -----     ---------------
    1-15     coordinate 1
   16-30     coordinate 2
   31-45     coordinate 3
   48-48     flag
   51-62     observatory name
   71-71     observatory one-letter code
   74-75     observatory two-letter code

If the flag is blank or zero, the coordinates are taken to be latitude
(ddmmss.ss), longitude (ddmmss.ss), and elevation (m).  If the flag is
non-blank, the coordinates are taken as X, Y, Z (m) about the
geocenter.

Each observatory can have a one-letter code and/or a two-letter code.

If an observatoy does not have a one-letter code, a dash ("-") should
be entered in place of the one-letter code.

Internally within tempo, the following integers are used for the
observatory codes.  These are also the observatory numbers written
to polyco.dat.
