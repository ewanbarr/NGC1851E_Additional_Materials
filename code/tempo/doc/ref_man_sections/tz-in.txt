TZ.IN FORMAT

The tz.in file is a free-format, ASCII file.  Items on a line may be
separated by any number of spaces and tabs.  

The first line contains default parameters:
  SITE        a one- or two-character site code 
  MAXHADEF    default maximum hour angle for observations (hr)
  NSPANDEF    default time span per ephemeris entry (minutes)
  NCOEFFDEF   default number of coefficients per ephemeris entry
  FREQDEF     default observing frequency (MHz)

The second and third lines are ignored.

Subsequent lines contain free-format entries for individual pulsars.  
Only the pulsar name is required.  Other values override default 
values (from the first line).
  NAME        pulsar name
  NSPAN       time span per ephemeris entry
  NCOEFF      number of coefficients per ephemeris
  MAXHA       maximum hour angle for observations
  FREQ        observing frequency (MHz)
